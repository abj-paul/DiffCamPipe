* About
In this project, we aim to create a differentiable ML pipeline for Camera.

Input RGB Image
    ↓
White Balance (learnable gain per channel)
    ↓
Gaussian Blur (simulating lens blur)
    ↓
Simple Tone Mapping (nonlinear curve or 1x1 Conv)
    ↓
Neural Network Head (e.g., regression/classification/super-res)
** AAA
High-Res Image (128x128)
    ↓
↓ Downsample (simulate low-res)
↓ White Balance (fixed RGB gain)
↓ Gaussian Blur (OpenCV)
↓ Tone Mapping (gamma correction)
    ↓
↑ Upsample (back to 128x128 using bicubic)
↓
Compare with original HR using MSE loss

High-Res Image (128x128)
↓
↓ Downsample (64x64)
↓ White Balance (fixed)
↓ Gaussian Blur (fixed)
↓ Tone Mapping (fixed)
↓
→ Feed into a trainable upsampler neural network (outputs 128x128)
↓
Compare with original HR using MSE loss

** Pipeline Components (Traditional)

    Input: High-res images

    Degrade: Downscale (simulate low-res)

    White balance: Multiply RGB by learnable gains

    Blur: Apply Gaussian blur

    Tone mapping: Simple gamma curve

    Upscale: Bicubic (baseline)

    Loss: MSE between predicted HR and ground-truth HR
